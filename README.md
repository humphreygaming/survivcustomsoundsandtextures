Many may know about the recently announced sunsetting of surviv.io, and if you don't, well, now you know. As it turns out, Google's decision to move away from Manifest V2 didn't end up causing the end of this extension; it was the shutting down of the related game itself. Considering that the last major feature update was on the 8th of September, 2022, and the most recent commit to this repo was on the 28th of November, 2022, it was pretty apparent that the project wasn't going anywhere soon. It's a shame development of a newer branch, essentially a complete overhaul of the extension, couldn't be continued. But all things come to an end, sooner or later. 

When I first started working on this project, way back in April of 2019, I had no serious intention for it to be this big. I never expected any attention whatsover. Now, almost 3 and a half years later, it's something I (fondly) look back at. I'm reminded of my sound design process, I'm reminded of my style. 

I'm also reminded of the Groza-S firing sound, and how some little shit insulted me on the way it sounded. Make of that what you will.

Jokes aside, I thank all contributors and collaborators who made this project possible:
- **brzsmg**, who helped make this into an actual extension that could be loaded into Google Chrome browsers. Very organized fellow.
- **IceHacks**, the big man himself, who chose to integrate this extension into both SCI V2 and V3. I reckon this and SCI are both the same age, and are now going out, mostly, together.
- **R&D Dog**, who inspired the "texture" part of the extension. Awesome guy whose cool experiments are an inspiration.
- **StabbyAlbert**, who provided some sounds as well as feedback. Overall a very important person.
- **Tungsten Hexaflouride**, who took on the task of overhauling most, if not all, of the sounds as well as choosing a "Last Survivr" theme. Developer of a secondary fork that would've eventually been merged with the "main" branch. For quite apparent reasons, that unfortunately didn't happen. However, this does not discard the effort put forth for this resource pack - for me - in any way whatsover. Their influence goes way above and beyond this extension, true merit.

And of course, thank you, user, for sticking around as long as you have. It's been a fun run, about as good as it gets. 

Until we meet again, farewell! - HumphreyGaming
